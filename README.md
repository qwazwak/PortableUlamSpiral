# PortableUlamSpiral
Gotta add to this..
To compile, you will need to add the static GMP lirary and boost inside the /libraries/ folder


End goal is to create a 100% cross platform portable Ulam spiral generator, there is plan, however, to add support for loading in external data for faster or easier prime generation or other number graphing

Things to do:
	Load data
	Find a data format
	write output data
	logging
	debuging
	GUI?
