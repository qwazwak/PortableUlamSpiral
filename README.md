# Universal Number Shape Generator
Gotta add to this..


End goal is to create a 100% cross platform portable pattern visuak, there is plan, however, to add support for loading in external data for faster or easier prime generation or other number graphing

Things to do:
	Load data
	Find a data format
	write output data
	logging
	debuging
	GUI?
